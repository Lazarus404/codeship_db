# CodeShip DB

This application is a simple, and rather incomplete, example of using a custom packet format for communicating with a custom data store.

## Installation

While in the application directory, run the following:

```
$ mix deps.get && iex -S mix
```

The server doesn't really do anything independently. To really see it in action, run the tests;

```
$ mix deps.get && mix test
```

This example was created to coinside with an article soon to be published on the [CodeShip Blog](https://blog.codeship.com/).  It will also be further developed prior to additional articles in the series.
